Procedure: Chest CT Scan with Contrast  

I consent to a computed tomography (CT) scan of my chest using contrast dye. I understand that contrast helps improve image quality but may cause allergic reactions or kidney issues in rare cases.

I have informed the radiology team about my allergies and health conditions. All procedures have been explained.

I agree to proceed with the CT scan and confirm that I understand the information provided.
