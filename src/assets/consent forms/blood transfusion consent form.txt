Procedure: Blood Transfusion  

I give my consent to receive a blood transfusion. I understand this involves receiving donated blood to treat my condition.

Possible risks include allergic reactions, fever, and very rare infections. Blood used is tested and matched for compatibility.

I confirm that the doctor has explained the purpose, benefits, and risks. I voluntarily agree to the transfusion.
