Procedure: Upper GI Endoscopy  

I give consent to undergo an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. I understand that a flexible tube will be inserted through my mouth to examine my esophagus and stomach.

I am aware of risks such as sore throat, nausea, bleeding, or rare perforation. Sedation may be used for comfort.

The doctor has explained the procedure, benefits, and risks. I voluntarily agree to proceed.
