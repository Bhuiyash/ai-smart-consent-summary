Patient Name: Sarah Kumar
Procedure: MRI Scan

I understand that an MRI scan involves using strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create images of internal structures.

I declare that I do not have any pacemakers, metal implants, or electronic medical devices that may be affected by magnetic fields.

Risks and discomforts may include loud noise, claustrophobia, or rare allergic reactions to contrast dye (if used).

I have been informed about the procedure and alternatives and voluntarily give consent for the MRI scan.
