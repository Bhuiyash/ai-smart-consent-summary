Procedure: Brain MRI Scan  

I consent to a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of my brain. I understand this involves no radiation but uses magnetic fields and radio waves.  

I confirm that I do not have any metallic implants, pacemakers, or devices that could be affected.  

Possible side effects include discomfort due to noise, and rare allergic reactions to contrast dye (if used). I understand the risks and voluntarily agree.
